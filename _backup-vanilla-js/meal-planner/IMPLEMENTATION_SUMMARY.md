### ‚úÖ Calculations Engine
```javascript
// BMR (assumes 175cm height for simplicity)
BMR = 10 √ó weight + 6.25 √ó 175 - 5 √ó age + 5

// TDEE with activity factor
TDEE = BMR √ó 1.55

// Goal adjustments
if (goal === "bulk") TDEE √ó 1.15
if (goal === "cut") TDEE √ó 0.85

// Testosterone-optimized macros
Protein = weight √ó 2g
Fat = (TDEE √ó 0.35) / 9
Carbs = (TDEE - protein√ó4 - fat√ó9) / 4
```
